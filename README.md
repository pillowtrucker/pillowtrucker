- 👋 Hi, I’m @pillowtrucker
- 👀 I’m interested in what **NETANYAHU KNEW** and when **HE KNEW IT**. Over 25000 **(TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND) DEAD CHILDREN and DEAD WOMEN** even according to **CONSERVATIVE** US estimates. **HOW(( is this not a **GENOCIDE** in any coherent worldview ???
- 💞️ (paused) I’m looking to collaborate on a wayland compositor using the mir-server libraries implementing just enough of the X11 API to save xmonad. Now not but at some point.
- 🚽 I'm making a game and its engine in 💩rust💩 and 🔬👍haskell🥰(✿ ♥‿♥) and probably ⚛️gluon☢️
